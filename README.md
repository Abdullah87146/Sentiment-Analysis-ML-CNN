# Sentiment-Analysis-ML-CNN

Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on a dataset using various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, Naive Bayes, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, and presents a comparative analysis of the models.

The project requires the following dependencies:
numpy, pandas, matplotlib, nltk, scikit-learn, tensorflow

# Model Training and Evaluation

Logistic Regression:
The Logistic Regression model is trained on the preprocessed data.
The model's accuracy and performance metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score, are evaluated and printed.

Linear SVM:
The Linear SVM model is trained and evaluated similarly to the Logistic Regression model.
The results, including accuracy and other performance metrics, are displayed.

Naive Bayes:
The Naive Bayes model is trained and its performance is assessed.
The accuracy and classification report are generated.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):
The CNN model is trained on the data, leveraging the power of deep learning for sentiment analysis.
The model's performance is evaluated, and metrics are printed.

Visualization
ROC curves for each model are plotted, providing a visual comparison of their performance. ROC AUC scores are also printed, offering a quantitative measure of each model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative sentiments.

Results
The results section includes accuracy scores, classification reports, and ROC AUC scores for each model. This comparative analysis helps in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each model, guiding the choice of the best model for sentiment analysis tasks.
